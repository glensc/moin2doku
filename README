moin2doku.py

A script for converting MoinMoin version 1.3+ wiki data to DokuWiki format.
Call with the name of the directory containing the MoinMoin pages and that
of the directory to receive the DokuWiki pages on the command line.

You need to run this on host where MoinMoin is configured and DokuWiki is
configured, it will use current configuration from both wikis.

Edit doku.php if your DokuWiki installation is other than /usr/share/dokuwiki

$ ./moin2doku.py ./moin/data/pages/

after conversion be sure to fix ownership
(www-data:www-data being your uid/gid webserver runs):
# chown -R www-data:www-data /var/lib/dokuwiki/pages/*
# chown -R www-data:www-data /var/lib/dokuwiki/media/*

This script doesn't do all the work, and some of the work it does is
wrong. For instance attachment links end up with the trailing "|}}"
on the line following the link. This works, but doesn't look good.
The script interprets a "/" in a pagename as a namespace delimiter and
creates and fills namespace subdirectories accordingly.
